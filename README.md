# SDSS 2025 Short Course Repository

This repo contains the resources used for 2 short courses presented at SDSS 2025: <br />

1. _Building Containerized Applications for Data Science_
2. _Accelerating Data Science Workflows with Kubernetes_

The goal of these resources is to enable Data Science students, practitioners, experts, and researchers to build
familiarity and competency with using Docker and Kubernetes for Data Science workflows

All of the compute used for these tutorials was performed on
the [National Research Platform](https://nationalresearchplatform.org/)
